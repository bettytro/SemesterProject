The assignment was to make an appealing website for the new museum opening in town. “The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.” 

## Description

The website was made to target primary and middle school children and families with young children. It needed at least 4 to 6 pages and should have information for the teachers and scientists. The HTML and CSS were supposed to be neat and follow the DRY principle. This project had a lot of focus on the design too, it needed to be sophisticated enough for a museum and still make children pay a visit. Under is some of the criteria we had to meet
