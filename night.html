                <h1 id="main">Night in the Museum</h1>
                <p class="ingress">Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.</p>
                <p class="m-t">In Brooklyn, Larry Daley is an aspiring inventor bouncing between jobs and apartments. His ex-wife Erica is sympathetic, but considers him a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick, and Larry worries that Nick admires Erica's fiancé Don instead. Larry is hired as the night security guard at the Museum of Natural History, replacing retiring guard Cecil Fredericks and his colleagues Gus and Reginald. Cecil gives Larry an instruction manual, warning him not to "let anything in... or out".

                    On his first night, Larry discovers that the museum's exhibits come to life after sunset, including: "Rexy", a playful Tyrannosaurus skeleton; Dexter, a mischievous stuffed capuchin monkey who destroys Larry's manual, and other taxidermied animals; rival miniature civilizations depicting the Old West, Ancient Rome, and Ancient Maya; a chewing gum-loving Easter Island Moai; wax models of Attila the Hun, American Civil War soldiers, and pyromaniacal Neanderthals, as well as Sacagawea, who is encased in glass. A mounted Teddy Roosevelt rescues Larry from feuding miniature leaders Jedediah and Octavius, and explains that ever since an ancient Egyptian artifact – the Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah – arrived in 1952, the exhibits come to life each night, but turn to dust if outside the museum at sunrise. As Teddy helps restore order, Larry learns that Teddy loves Sacagawea but is too shy to speak to her.
                    
                    Cecil, Reginald, and Gus check on Larry, who has decided to quit, but Nick and Don stop by to congratulate him on his new job. Larry decides to stay for his son's sake, and Cecil advises reading up on history. Larry is better able to control the exhibits, but is forced to extinguish a fire in the Neanderthals' display, while Dexter steals Larry's keys and unlocks a window, allowing a Neanderthal to escape onto the street. Frustrated, Larry again decides to quit, and is unable to save the escaped Neanderthal from disintegrating in the rising sun. Nick witnesses museum director Dr. McPhee fire Larry over the damaged Neanderthal exhibit, though Larry convinces him to reconsider. Rebecca Hutman, a museum guide and historian writing her dissertation on Sacagawea, believes Larry is mocking her when he tells her the museum's nighttime secret.
                    
                    Larry brings Nick to the museum but nothing comes to life, and they discover Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing the deactivated tablet. Like the exhibits, the elderly guards receive enhanced vitality from the tablet, and have plotted to steal it with other valuable artifacts and frame Larry. Nick reactivates the tablet, bringing the museum back to life, but Cecil takes it and locks Nick and Larry in the Egyptian room. Larry releases Ahkmenrah's mummy from his sarcophagus, and the pharaoh helps Larry and Nick escape. They find the other exhibits fighting amongst themselves, and Larry convinces them to unite to catch the guards and recover the tablet.
                    
                    Gus and Reginald are captured, while Cecil escapes in a Pony Express stagecoach, and Teddy pushes Sacagawea out of Cecil's path and is sliced in half. Larry pursues Cecil into Central Park, stopping him and regaining the tablet, and Teddy finally bonds with Sacagawea as she repairs him. Rebecca sees the exhibits returning to the museum and realizes the truth, and Larry introduces her to Sacagawea. The next day, McPhee fires Larry after news reports about the night's strange events – such as the Neanderthals leaving cave paintings in the museum's subway station, and Rexy's dinosaur tracks in Central Park – but the publicity boosts museum attendance. Larry is rehired, and celebrates that night with Nick and the exhibits.
                    
                    During the end credits, Cecil, Gus and Reginald are forced to work as museum janitors as punishment for their crimes.</p>
